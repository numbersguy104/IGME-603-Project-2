Make customers happy through early and continuous delivery of useful software: Customers don’t care about your internal processes — they just want a product that works. Traditional methods make them wait months (or even years) for a finished product. Agile flips that by delivering small, usable updates early and often.
Embrace changing requirements, even in later stages: If you’re afraid of change, Agile probably isn’t for you. Some teams try to fight evolving requirements, but customer needs change. Agile embraces that instead of resisting it.
Deliver work frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale: Some teams spend months planning before they write a single line of code. That’s often a mistake. Agile cross-functional teams break projects into short cycles (usually two to four weeks) and release something usable at the end of each one.
